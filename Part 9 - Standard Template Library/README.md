# Standard Template Library

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.

STL has four components

1. Algorithms
2. Containers
3. Functions
4. Iterators

Grasping the STL will enhance your competitive programming career.

Here we will cover necessary Algorithms and Functions while dealing with various containers through iterators.

All you need for 
- Arrays
- Vectors
- Pairs
- Sets
- Maps
- Unordered Maps

is here.

Also some problems of CodeForces are solved here just using the STL library to show you the domains and possibilities of STL.
