Here we will be introduced to the fundamentals of organised contiguous data structures for data storage and manipulations(operations).

Fundamentals of the following will be covered
- Arrays
- Vectors/Lists

- Multidimensional Arrays and Matrices
- Pointers in C++ and tackling data structures using pointers

More of collections will be covered under *STL* later in this course.
